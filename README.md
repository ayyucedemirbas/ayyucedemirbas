### Hi there 👋

<!--
**ayyucedemirbas/ayyucedemirbas** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a computer engineering undergraduate student and a researcher, trying to make the World a better place using my engineering skills. My interests are machine learning, operating systems, computer architecture and design, and wireless communication. I also interested in astronomy and astrophysics as an amateur. My career goals include obtaining a Master's degree and a PhD, ultimately contributing awesome research projects and teaching at the college level.
