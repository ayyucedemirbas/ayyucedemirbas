### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨ 
I'm a computer engineering undergraduate student and a researcher, trying to make the World a better place using my engineering skills. My interests are machine learning, operating systems, computer architecture and design, and wireless communication. I also interested in astronomy and astrophysics as an amateur. My career goals include obtaining a Master's degree and a PhD, ultimately contributing awesome research projects and teaching at the college level.
